# Geolocational_data
Implementing the project will take you through the daily life of a data science engineer -
from data preparation on real-life datasets, to visualising the data and running machine
learning algorithms, to presenting the results.

In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, It’s a
frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course,
even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good
meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly
understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect
of the lifestyle one leads.
